# Welcome to the Mothers Touch App Repository!
## Description 
*What's the goal of this app?*
Through the Mother’s Touch app initiative, we hope mothers will be able to better equip themselves in terms of how to care for their newborns, how to care for themselves, as well as find important information on COVID-19 vaccines, etc. Additionally, this project is a part of a program with The Women’s Health Institute (WHI) at Robert Wood Johnson Hospital. The WHI will be using data on blood pressure and other factors, collected through our app (if users opt-in), in an ongoing study they are conducting.

## Where is it available?
This app will be debuting on the Apple Store in mid-May 2021!
